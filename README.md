# A Repo For All Frontend Mentor Projects

Instead of creating multiple repos for every potential Frontend Mentor challenge I complete, I opted to have one repo
containing all the challenges. It makes things much more organized and easy to find. 

This repo will be updated as I complete more projects. Each project has its own little README discussing how
I approached the challenge, what I learned, etc. 

Not much else to add right now. I'll update this README as things develop if at all there is any need to do so.
